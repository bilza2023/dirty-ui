I want you to give me analysis on this plan / idea:

A very small team based in islamabad starts an AI startup in pakistan , in which they have a plan to install some free LLM on digital ocean droplet and then build services on top of it.

--> keeping in view this setup or any other better setup in which a pakistani firm build services on top of existing LLM free or commercial in a very simple way and just build their services on top.
also what services there can be ? fields etc /example
