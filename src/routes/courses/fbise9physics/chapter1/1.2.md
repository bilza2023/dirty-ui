## 🎙️ Narration Notes

---

### Slide 1: Definition of Physical Quantities

* Physical quantities describe physical phenomena in measurable terms.
* Always require two parts: a number (magnitude) and a unit (standard).
* Example: 5 meters means quantity is 5 and unit is meter.
* Without measurement, scientific communication is impossible.

---

### Slide 2: Base and Derived Quantities

* **Base Quantities:** Defined independently; 7 in total. Used as building blocks.
* **Derived Quantities:** Result from mathematical combinations of base quantities.
* Example: Speed = distance/time → m/s.
* Important to understand classification for solving physics problems.

---

### Slide 3: SI Units of Base Quantities

* The **SI system (International System of Units)** ensures global consistency.
* Each base quantity has a standard unit (e.g., kilogram for mass).
* Units are defined by physical constants or experimental setups.
* Mastery of these is essential for scientific precision.

---

### Slide 4: Why Use Physical Quantities?

* Science needs clarity – standardized measurements prevent confusion.
* Engineers, doctors, scientists use these every day.
* Global scientific collaboration depends on shared units and methods.
* From space missions to medicine – all rely on precise quantities.
